v4.0 (2019-12-04)
* Testgen
    * Extended support to FreeRTOS for a wide variety of tests
    * Added Information Leakage tests (FreeRTOS & Debian Linux)
        * CWE-202, CWE-203, CWE-209, CWE-212, CWE-226, CWE-321, CWE-524, CWE-612, CWE-707
    * Added a Numeric Error test for Debian Linux
        * CWE-456
    * Adapted several Permissions, Privileges, and Access Control (PPAC) tests to FreeRTOS 
        * CWE-799, CWE-307, CWE-837
    * Various enhancements and bugfixes to feature-harness
    * As a reminder, testgen is currently compatible with all P1 and P2 processors, 
    but only supports Debian Linux and FreeRTOS. FreeBSD support will be added in upcoming releases. 
    Busybox Linux can be used for debugging purposes only on FPGA

v3.0 (2019-10-22)
* testgen platform is now available for use:
    * The platform is currently compatible with all P1 and P2 processors, but only supports Debian Linux
    * All P1 and P2 processors are supported.
    * Backend and OS: Only Debian Linux is supported on both Qemu and on FPGA. 
    Busybox Linux can be used on FPGA for debugging purposes, but security evaluation 
    tests on Busybox Linux are not part of SSITH, so they are not going to be developed. 
    Simulation flow is only bare metal for now.
    * Vulnerability Classes: The permission, privileges, and access control (PPAC) 
    class has some tests, and the buffer errors class has some preliminary efforts. 
    
v2.0 (2019-08-15)
* Updates core functionality, enhances the UI and several key tools related to 
proving hardware security, and addresses multiple issues across several repositories
