v4.2 (2020-01-14)
* #56 Added  “How To” documentation for testing custom processors with Tool Suite (adding custom bitstreams, forked repositories, and/or custom simulators to the Tool Suite system build and test harness) 
* Testgen
  * Added ability to customize Testgen’s scoring and compiler options. Changes can be made using Testgen’s config.ini file under “#Scoring Environment” and “#Compiler Environment”
  * Buffer Overflow class: simplified test generation, added checks for invalid tests, and changed results to be reported in terms of CWEs 
  * Added new CWE tests:
    * Permissions, Privileges, and Access Control (PPAC)
      * FreeRTOS
        * CWE-257, CWE-259, CWE-301 
    * Buffer Overflow Errors (BOF)
      * FreeRTOS and Debian Linux
        * CWE-118, CWE-119, CWE-120, CWE-121, CWE-122, CWE-123, CWE-124, CWE-125, CWE-126, CWE-127
        , CWE-129, CWE-786, CWE-787, CWE-788, CWE-823
* UI
  * Updated feature model configurator UI to display Clafer (rather than FMJSON), improving readability

v4.1 (2019-12-17)
* Testgen
    * Added a Numeric Errors class proof-of-concept test 
      * [Link to PoC](https://gitlab-ext.galois.com/ssith/poc-exploits/tree/master/7_NumericErrors/skein) 
    * Added several PPAC CWE tests for FreeRTOS:
      * CWE 284, CWE 287, CWE 288, CWE 289, CWE 290, CWE 294
    * Added a Resource Management CWE test for Debian Linux
      * CWE 772
    * Fixed an issue with Debug Mode on Debian Linux (while running on FPGA)
    * Misc. fixes and enhancements to the test harness
* UI
    * Added React framework (not the default, on a separate port)
    * User selection of features is now tracked within the graphical representation of a feature model 
    * The UI is now a multi-page app, which resolves undo/redo configurator issues related to single-page state management

v4.0 (2019-12-04)
* Testgen
    * Extended support to FreeRTOS for a wide variety of tests
    * Added Information Leakage tests (FreeRTOS & Debian Linux)
        * CWE-202, CWE-203, CWE-209, CWE-212, CWE-226, CWE-321, CWE-524, CWE-612, CWE-707
    * Added a Numeric Error test for Debian Linux
        * CWE-456
    * Adapted several Permissions, Privileges, and Access Control (PPAC) tests to FreeRTOS 
        * CWE-799, CWE-307, CWE-837
    * Various enhancements and bugfixes to feature-harness
    * As a reminder, testgen is currently compatible with all P1 and P2 processors, 
    but only supports Debian Linux and FreeRTOS. FreeBSD support will be added in upcoming releases. 
    Busybox Linux can be used for debugging purposes only on FPGA

v3.0 (2019-10-22)
* testgen platform is now available for use:
    * The platform is currently compatible with all P1 and P2 processors, but only supports Debian Linux
    * All P1 and P2 processors are supported.
    * Backend and OS: Only Debian Linux is supported on both Qemu and on FPGA. 
    Busybox Linux can be used on FPGA for debugging purposes, but security evaluation 
    tests on Busybox Linux are not part of SSITH, so they are not going to be developed. 
    Simulation flow is only bare metal for now.
    * Vulnerability Classes: The permission, privileges, and access control (PPAC) 
    class has some tests, and the buffer errors class has some preliminary efforts. 
    
v2.0 (2019-08-15)
* Updates core functionality, enhances the UI and several key tools related to 
proving hardware security, and addresses multiple issues across several repositories
